    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, not the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

As expected, this produced an $R^2$ of zero for both the training and test set, because $R^2$ tells us how much of the variance you're explaining beyond that of using just the mean, and you were using just the mean. Here we see that our simple linear regression model explains over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. Clearly you are onto something, although the much lower value for the test set suggests you're overfitting somewhat. This isn't a surprise as you've made no effort to select a parsimonious set of features or deal with multicollinearity in our data."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** At this stage in the DSM for this project, it has been decided to treat all states equally, and a few features have been identified to be highly correlated with ticket price. The goal of this step was to preprocess the data for implementation in a machine learning pipeline. First, we validated the row from the DataFrame that contained our observation of interest, Big Mountain Resort in Montana. This row was removed from the DF as the model would be trained on the data that our resort will ultimately be compared to.  To avoid over-fitting the model, a 70/30 test/train split using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split()`. The `ski_data` DF without the `\"AdultWeekend\"` column was selected to construct the `X_train` and `X_test` matrices, and the ticket price column `\"AdultWeekend\"` contructed the `y_train` and `y_test` vectors. Of course, the categorical feature columns representing the names, states, and regions of each resort were dropped from the testing matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was noted in the introduction to the notebook that it is important to consider that your model performed better than simply calculating the mean of the list `y_train`. The mean was calculated using the `pd.mean()` method, and also using the `sklearn.dummy.DummyRegressor()` function on the `X_train` DF and `y_train` series. These means agreed. To test the fit the “model” (which in this case is to simply use the mean ticket prices as the predictor). \n",
    "The first metric with which to test this “model” was the R2 value. An `r_squared` function was defined which takes in a series of values and model-predicted mean. This was function was passed the training data and the predicted mean (which in this case was equal to actual mean of the training data), and expectedly produced an R2 value of 0. The function was called again the `y_test` series, and again the literal mean of the training series. Again, as expected, the R2 was nearly zero. Similar functions were created for mean absolute error and mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions were called using the same arguments as before. For practical purposes, these same metrics were computed using the `sklearn.metrics` functions: `r2_score()`, `mean_absolute_error()`, and `mean_sqaured_error()`.\n",
    "Reasonably, we can assume that better models exist than simply averaging the test data. The next few sections of the notebook explored a linear regression and random forest model. In order to do this, missing values needed to be imputed. Considering some long-tailed distributions discovered during EDA, the column medians were first used to impute missing values. To fit the data to the linear regression model, the data was scaled using `sklearn`’s `StandardScaler()` function. The scaler was fit to the training model and applied to the training and test model. Training and test predictions were calculated using `LinearRegression`’s `.predict()` method. The R2 values differed by about 10% between the training and test set, which suggested overfitting of the training model. The MAE and MSE values were computed for the training and test series, and dramatic improvement were seen compared the mean “model” used previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was worth considering that it may be beneficial to compare the process when imputing the missing values with means. There was very little difference, implying again that overfitting/overtraining was the more severe issue. Once again for demonstrative purposes, `sklearn`’s built-in `make_pipeline()` was used to facilitate the process of testing the model with differing imputation methods. The results were exactly the same, but the process was much more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we attempted to refine the Linear Model using the `SelectKBest()` function. This repeated the linear regression process using the (by default) 10 features determined by the function to be most impactful, but the MSE and R2 values produced were worse. We tried again with the best 15 features, and the results were better than `k=10` but still worse than before subsetting the features.  A five-fold cross-validation was conducted to produce a better estimate of the model’s performance by creating five partitions of the training data and testing each against the other four. So, cross validation produces a metric for the model’s performance, but still does not tell us the best value for `k`. The `GridSearchCV()` function was useful here because it allowed us to easily perform a 5-fold CV, multiple times testing every possible `k` value. The `GridSearchCV` object has an attribute `.best_params_` which showed that `k=8` produced the best model. The `GridSearchCV` object also allowed us to the access the `.coef_` attribute of the linear regression model. The features with the highest correlation coefficients were `vertical_drop`, `Snow Making_ac`, `total_chairs`, `fastQuads`, `Runs`, `LongestRun_mi`, `trams`, and `SkiableTerrain_ac` in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it was time to test out the Random Forest Model. The pipline was altered to replace the `LinearRegression()` function with the `RandomForestRegressor()` and the `SelectKBest()` function was removed. The pipline object was named `RF_pipe`. A 5-fold cross validation was again conducted. The scores had a slightly higher mean and lower standard deviation. Using `GridSearchCV()` again we tested the Random Forest using multiple estimators and with/without a scaler. The `.best_params_` attribute showed that the median was the better imputing strategy, and no scaling was more effective. Using these parameters, the highest mean CV results with least variance were achieved. We calculated the feature importance ratios of the model using the best parameters. The dominant top four features were `fastQuads`, `Runs`, `Snow Making_ac`, and `vertical_drop` in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it was time to choose between the linear regression and random forest model. The mean absolute error was calculated for each using a 5-fold cross validation once again, using `\"neg_mean_absolute_error\"` as the scoring parameter. The random forest model decreased the mean absolute error by just under $1 and reduced the variance. So, ultimately the random forest model was selected as the final model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A call of the `learning_curve()` function verified that a training set size of about 50 features was sufficient for maximum CV scores, so it was determined that there was no need to collect more data. The random forest model was saved as `best_model`."
